# Work Pilot

## Vision

An AI assistant designed to handle all day-to-day work tasks autonomously. You give it any task relevant to your role, and it takes care of it.

## Core Concept

- **Universal Task Handler**: Accept any work-related task and execute it end-to-end
- **Role-Aware**: Understands your specific role, responsibilities, and workflows
- **Autonomous Execution**: Completes tasks independently with minimal intervention
- **Adaptive**: Learns your preferences and work patterns over time

## Potential Capabilities

- Email drafting and management
- Document creation and editing
- Meeting scheduling and preparation
- Research and summarization
- Data analysis and reporting
- Code and technical tasks
- Communication on your behalf
- Task prioritization and workflow management

## Design Principles

1. **Trust**: Act reliably so users can delegate with confidence
2. **Transparency**: Clearly communicate what actions are being taken
3. **Efficiency**: Minimize user effort while maximizing output quality
4. **Safety**: Always confirm before irreversible actions
